I did not host this website because the API provides data for free only in localhost. So to see how the project is follow the steps below:


STEP 1: First clone this project in your local device.

STEP 2: After cloning this project, do npm install in terminal to install all the dependencies needed to run the website.

STEP 3: Make a file named ".env" and add your API there. Check out ".env_sample". To get your own API log on to "newsapi.org".

STEP 4: Do npm start to run the development server.


NOTE: Make sure you have nodeJS installed in your device.
